\title{\textbf{SQL Queries for Hospital Staff Shift Allocation \\ Task-Based Report}}
\author{Zhe Guan  \\ email: \texttt{zg2u24@soton.ac.uk}}
\date{October 2024}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

This report primarily addresses seven tasks based on a Hospital Staff Shift Allocation dataset using SQL queries.

The main environment and some details are described below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Database System:} SQLite
    \item \textbf{Validation Tool:} Queries validated with DB Browser for SQLite.
    \item \textbf{Join Type:} To avoid possible data loss due to missing values, \texttt{LEFT JOIN} is commonly used.
    \item \textbf{Approach for Tasks 6 and 7:} Two methods are provided for each task.
    \item \textbf{Name Output Format:} To meet the task requirements, all output names follow the format '[first name][surname]'. For example, '[GEORGIA][STEVENSON]'.
    \item \textbf{Available Output Formats:} Magic commands are used to display SQL query results in Jupyter Notebook, as shown in the attachment~\ref{attachment}.
    \item \textbf{Materials:} All relevant materials except original dataset are available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/phy-guanzh/Hospital_Staff_Shift_Allocation}.
\end{itemize}



\section{Task 1}
\textbf{Task: Output the total number of hours that the staff member with ID number 10566 has worked in the given time period. You can assume that each shift lasts for 8 hours.}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=sqlstyle]

    allocation_people_id AS peopleID,
    COUNT(allocation_ID) AS allocation_times,
    COUNT(allocation_ID) * 8 AS allocation_hours

    allocation
WHERE 
    allocation_people_id = 10566
GROUP BY

And the output showed in table.\ref{tab:task4}, and "RONNIE WHITE" and "MATILDA JAMIESON" should be focused.


\section{Task 5}

\textbf{Task: Output the number of each staff type (consultant, doctor, health care assistant, nurse) working each shift for the emergency department ward (ED) on 1 May 2024.}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=sqlstyle]

        WHEN  "Consultant" THEN 1 --- we may use CASE command.
        WHEN  "Doctor" THEN 2  --- to make it easier, we can also use alphabetic order aka
        WHEN  "Health Care Assistant"  THEN 3 --- " band.band_type  ASC"
        ELSE 4
    END
\end{lstlisting}

Answer is provided in Table.~\ref{tab:task5}.

    \label{tab:task5}
\end{table}

\section{Task 6}

\textbf{Task: Output the total number of hours worked by each type of staff member (health care assistant, nurse, doctor, consultant) for each month from January to August 2024.}

Here, two methods could be used. 

One is nested query shown below.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=sqlstyle]
--- Here we apply a Nested Query
SELECT
    sub.band_type,
    sub.month,
    SUM(sub.hours) AS total_hours
FROM (
    SELECT
        band.band_type,
        strftime("%m",allocation.allocation_date) AS month,
        CASE
            WHEN shift.shift_end > shift.shift_start  
            THEN (strftime("%H", shift.shift_end)-strftime("%H", shift.shift_start))
            ELSE (strftime("%H", shift.shift_end)+ 24 - strftime("%H", shift.shift_start))
        END AS hours
    FROM
        allocation
    LEFT JOIN
        people ON allocation.allocation_people_id = people.people_id
    LEFT JOIN
        band ON band.band_id = people.people_band
    LEFT JOIN
        shift ON shift.shift_id = allocation.allocation_shift
) AS sub
GROUP BY
    sub.band_type, sub.month
ORDER BY  ---- define the order to meet the requirement of question
    CASE band_type 
        WHEN "Health care assistant" THEN 1
        WHEN "Nurse" THEN 2
        WHEN "Doctor" THEN 3
        WHEN "Consultant" THEN 4
    END
\end{lstlisting}


Another method perfered is Common Table Expression(CTE), which is a temporary ``table" defined within a single SQL statement. It is created using the ``WITH"  keyword and can be referenced multiple times within the main query. Compared to Nested Query, CTE has better readability and maintainability and supports recursive queries.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=sqlstyle]
--- Here we apply a Common Table Expression 
--- which has better readability and maintainability compared to Nested Query

WITH  computed_hours AS (
SELECT
    allocation.allocation_ID,
    CASE
        WHEN  shift.shift_end > shift.shift_start  
        THEN ( strftime("%H",shift.shift_end)- strftime("%H",shift.shift_start))  
        --- Here we use strftime to get the corresponding time for SQLite, which can also be used in 
        --- the next question7.
        --- eg hours -> %H,minites -> %M, year ->%y, month ->%m, day -> %d
        ELSE  ( strftime("%H",shift.shift_end)+24 - strftime("%H",shift.shift_start))  
    END AS hours
FROM   allocation
LEFT JOIN
    shift 
    ON shift.shift_id = allocation.allocation_shift
)

SELECT
    band.band_type,
    strftime("%m",allocation_date) AS months,
    SUM(hours) AS total_hours
FROM
    allocation
LEFT JOIN
    people
    ON allocation.allocation_people_id =  people.people_id
LEFT JOIN
    band
    ON band.band_id = people.people_band
LEFT JOIN
    shift
    ON shift.shift_id = allocation.allocation_shift
LEFT JOIN
    computed_hours
    ON computed_hours.allocation_ID = allocation.allocation_ID
GROUP BY
    band.band_type,months
ORDER BY   ---- define the order to meet the requirement of question
    CASE band_type 
        WHEN "Health care assistant" THEN 1
        WHEN "Nurse" THEN 2
        WHEN "Doctor" THEN 3
        WHEN "Consultant" THEN 4
    END
	
\end{lstlisting}

The output table is provided in Table.~\ref{tab:task6}.

\begin{table}[h]

   \caption{The total number of hours worked by each type of staff member (health care assistant,
nurse, doctor, consultant) for each month from January to August 2024}
    \label{tab:task6}
\end{table}


\section{Task 7}

\textbf{Task: Output the total staff costs for each specialty between 1 January 2024 and 31 August
2024. The total staff costs of a specialty are equal to the number of shifts worked by
each staff member for that specialty multiplied by their cost per shift.}

\begin{equation}
C_i=\sum_T \sum_P \delta_{i t p} c_p
\end{equation}
\textbf{Where}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\text {  }\\
&\delta_{i t p}= \begin{cases}1 & \text { \textbf{Person} } p \text { \textbf{works within specialty} } i \text { \textbf{and worked in shift} } t \\ 0 & \textbf { otherwise }\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\textbf{and T is the set of all shifts, P is the set of all staff members, and $c_p$ is the cost of
paying staff member p for one shift. When calculating the cost per shift of a member
of staff, assume that a full-time member of staff works 230 shifts per year and that the
salary figures given in the band table are the amount paid to a member of staff for one
year’s work.}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=sqlstyle]
--- Here we apply a Nested Query
SELECT 
    sub.people_specialty,
    SUM( sub.times*sub.band_salary_pershift) AS total_expenses
FROM (
    SELECT 
    allocation.allocation_people_id,
    COUNT(allocation_shift) AS times,
    people_specialty,
    people_band,
    band_salary,
    ROUND(band_salary/230,4)  AS band_salary_pershift 
FROM 
    allocation
LEFT JOIN
    people
    ON people.people_id = allocation.allocation_people_id
LEFT JOIN
    band
    ON band.band_id = people.people_band
GROUP BY
    allocation.allocation_people_id
 )  AS  sub
GROUP BY 
    sub.people_specialty





\end{lstlisting}

similar to Task 6, we can also use CTE to solve the Task 7 shown below:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=sqlstyle]
WITH personal_salary AS (
    SELECT 
	allocation.allocation_people_id,
	COUNT(allocation_shift) AS times,
	people_specialty,
	people_band,
	band_salary,
	ROUND(band_salary/230,4)  AS band_salary_pershift 
    FROM 
	allocation
    LEFT JOIN
	people
	ON people.people_id = allocation.allocation_people_id
    LEFT JOIN
	band
	ON band.band_id = people.people_band
    GROUP BY
	allocation.allocation_people_id )
		
SELECT 
    personal_salary.people_specialty,
    SUM( personal_salary.times*personal_salary.band_salary_pershift) AS total_expenses
FROM 
    personal_salary
GROUP BY 
    personal_salary.people_specialty


\end{lstlisting}

The output table is provided in Table~\ref{tab:task7}.
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline & people\_specialty & total\_expenses \\
